# CapstoneProject_Course9_Week5

This is a short note to the peer who will grade my submission.

Hi,

As my IBM Cloud account reached its compute limit, I can't use Cognos for visualization because I will have to use Watson studio for that. 

That's why coursera team provided this alternative way to upload the pdf on GitHub downloaded from "Cognos Analytics with Watson", which doesn't have any feature to share the link of the dashboard with permission "anyone can see".

The last step they advised is to provide this link instead of Cognos link with my submission on Week 5 submission.

Thanks for your understanding!
